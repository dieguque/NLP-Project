Using the 2014-2015 Apple related tweets dataset I was able to get a topic modeling that will allow me to do the sentiment test.

Sentiment towards Apple.

## 1. Topic Modelings - NMF

Tweets are popular way to share opinion in a relatively short way, I chose NMF as my method on analyzing the interpretable topic models. Hereâ€™s what I found:


- topic_0 : strong hate tweet agains Apple fuck, shit, hate, fix
- topic_1 : neutral, most of them were Apple news - iphon, decemb, new, stock, watch, price

**What do the topics tell you about the overall structure of the data?**
-  Most of tweets are contain a negative image of Apple. People tend to tweet when they have a bad experience or are again Apple.
-  The tweets are quite old. Today's performance will be pretty different. Apple, like any tech company, has changed over the years.
